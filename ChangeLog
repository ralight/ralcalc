1.3.1.1 (20090110)
==================

- Clarify licence on a source file.


1.3.1 (20090107)
================

- Use dynamic allocation for the .ralcalc_result path string to avoid possible
  truncation leading to the incorrect file being opened.
- Minor code tidy-ups, including more consistent error code handling.
- Complete Brazilian Portugese translations thanks to Enrico Nicoletto.
- Some French translation of the man page thanks to Pierre Rudloff.
- United Kingdom English translations thanks to Jen Ockwell (I'm UK English
  anyway, but it's nice to have someone else check what I've written!)


1.3.0 (20081218)
================

- Preserve some spaces in equations when output. This will compress multiple
  spaces into a single space, but there will always be at least a single space
  in the output if there is one in the input.
- Added support for the "-s prefix" option to allow the output to be formatted
  with a specified SI prefix.
- Fixed bug where SI prefixes entered on their own were treated as a number of
  value zero. This means that "= 1/p" correctly produces an error now.
- Fixed bug that caused incorrect handling of "sqrt".
- Errors and debug messages are now written on stderr.
- The man page is now written in docbook format to allow easier translation.
- Included Basque translations thanks to Mikel Alzibar.
- Included Polish translations thanks to "pp/bs".
- Included further Brazilian Portugese translations thanks to Enrico
  Nicoletto.


1.2.4 (20081114)
================

- Fix bug whereby the precedence wasn't reset correctly after processing a
  pair of brackets. This would lead to problems with calculations where a
  power directly followed a close bracket: [2+3]^3.
- Included Brazilian Portugese translations thanks to Ricardo Ichizo.
- Included French translations thanks to Djalil Oulmane.
- Included Spanish translations thanks to Daniel.


1.2.3 (20080916)
================

- By request, explicit support for square root (sqrt) has been added.


1.2.2 (20080915)
================

- Added support for the "-a" option which prints out all of the available
  operators, functions and constants.


1.2.1 (20080718)
================

- Fixed a string buffer that was being allocated one byte too small and would
  occasionally lead to spurious "invalid operator" errors.


1.2.0 (20080609)
================

- Included Hebrew translations thanks to Yaron and a start at Spanish
  translations thanks to Eduardo Ruiz.
- Support for % (modulus) operator, sin/cos/tan/asin/acos/atan functions and
  pi/exp constants.


1.1.0 (20080601)
================

- Added the "-f filename" option. This will process each line of "filename" as
  though it was typed in at the command line.
- Added the "-i" option which does the same as "-f" but for stdin.
- Added support for log/ln functions.


1.0.1 (20080322)
================

- Fixed missing config.mk from distributed tarball.


1.0 (20080322)
==============

- i18n / L10n support.
- Big cleanup of directory structure.
- Makefile improvements - including use of DESTDIR.
- Change license to GPL - many of the Makefile improvements come from a GPL
  project.


20070712
========

- Added the "-r" option which causes the output to use neither SI prefixes nor
  exponents.


20070702
========

- Added the "-q" option which causes ralcalc to only display the result rather
  than the input and the result (or the input and errors).

- Added the "-e" option which causes the output to be of the form "1e-3"
  rather than using SI prefixes.

- Return code is set correctly on error.


20070617
========

- Negation now has the correct precedence.


20070616
========

- Precedence is now reset correctly after processing brackets. Previously it
  was being set one value too low, so the power (^) operator was being missed
  out for e.g. "= [1+2]^3", which would return the answer "3".

- Bracket matching has been improved, so if there are more close brackets than
  open it is detected.


20070614
========

- Fixed Makefile for Mac OS X.
- Included missing "=.1" to dist target.
- Fixed uninstall target.


20070613
========

- Added support for 1e3, 3e-6 style numbers.


20070610
========

- Changed output format for numbers <0 so that it they are displayed as
  follows:

  1/10    = 0.1
  1/100   = 10m
  1/1000  = 1m
  1/10000 = 0.1m

- Allow use of () brackets as well as [], directly equivalent to each other.

- Fixed operator precedence: (), ^, */, +_. Negation of single number is still
  considered first.
 
- Added support for the "," as a decimal point - this is handled by strtod()
  so it is locale dependent whether "." or "," is accepted as valid.

- Added man pages.
